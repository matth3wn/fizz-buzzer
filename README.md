## Fizz Buzz Time!
The application should display the text fizz or buzz when the total elapsed
time (in seconds) is a multiple of fizz or buzz respectively. The application should
display fizzbuzz whenever the total elapsed time is a multiple of both fizz and
buzz. The user should be able to enter an integer value for fizz and buzz. The
fizz and buzz values will range from 2 through 10 seconds (inclusive). Fizz and
buzz values cannot be changed once any time has elapsed (i.e. the elapsed time
is greater than zero).
For instance, if fizz is 2, buzz is 3 and the total elapsed time is 1 minute 6
seconds, the application should display fizzbuzz.
